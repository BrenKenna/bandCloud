# bandCloud

The repository links to the related repos because it was easier for me to manage them separately. The API was developed using eclipse IDE & commit history is lacking. Angular & deployment apps developed using VSCode simpler GitHub integration.

Added write-up as project was dissertation, and link to video demo https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DJ4eTSAMjDkpc2EFCUTnTze-Pds3HRVL?usp=share_link
